# Getting Started
## Data Sourcing
After downloading  the dataset file in Excel format, we start by creating 3 new sheets:
1.	"Working" sheet: a copy of the original data where we can perform all the cleaning procedures, without worrying about transforming or even losing our raw table.
2.	"Pivot Calculation" sheet: where we create Pivot Tables according to our need.
3.	"Dashboard" sheet: where we insert the visualizations of our analysis as well as the slicers to filter our data.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Removing duplicates, unwanted cells and irrelevant columns.
2.	Replacing values with more meaningful entries  using FIND and REPLACE functions.
3.	Formatting the data column and converting the data to table for pivot table calculation.
